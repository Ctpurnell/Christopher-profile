This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React App

This app was created using React-create-app. The great thing about that is how much of the scaffolding is done for you! Form there I wanted to:

Use React to render content.

Have a single Header component that appears on multiple pages, with a Navigation component within it that’s used to conditionally render About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections.

Have a single Project component that’s used multiple times in the Portfolio section.

Have a single Footer component that appears on multiple pages.

And be deployed to GitHub Pages.

This Assignment can be opened in VS Code by running `npm start`

The application has been deployed at gitHub pages at:
